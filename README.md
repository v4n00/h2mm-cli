# Helldivers 2 Mod Manager CLI

Helldivers 2 Mod Manager CLI is a command line interface for managing Helldivers 2 mods. Since there is no Linux mod manager available and I like being a nerd by using CLI tools instead of GUIs, this project was born.

This mod manager is complete, the version will always [remain at 0.x.x](https://0ver.org/). Version 0.6.x will be the last version of this mod manager.

## Installation

Pre-requisites:

- You must have the `unzip` package installed for zip archives;
- You might want to have the `unarchiver` package installed for rar archives.

To install Helldivers 2 Mod Manager CLI run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/v4n00/h2mm-cli/refs/heads/master/install.sh)"
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Running this script will require sudo permissions. **DO NOT TRUST** random scripts from the internet. If you want to review the script before running it, check out the repository for yourself.

## Usage

The script gets added to `/usr/local/bin/h2mm` (or `$HOME/.local/bin` on Steam Deck) and can be used by running `h2mm` in your shell, which will show the help message explaining how to use the script.

```bash
h2mm
```

### Examples

To find out how to use a command, you can run `h2mm <COMMAND> --help`.

#### Install mod(s)

```bash
h2mm install mod.zip
h2mm install /path/to/mod/directory/
h2mm install /path/to/mod.zip /path/to/mod2.zip /path/to/mod/files # mix and match hoewever you want
h2mm install -n "Example mod" mod.patch_0 mod.patch_0.stream # -n is mandatory when using files
```

> It's better to be in the directory where the mod files are located, so you don't have to specify the full path. For mod downloads, you can do `cd ~/Downloads` and then run the command.
>
> Also, use the Tab key to autocomplete the file names, as it will help you escape special characters likes spaces or quotes.

#### List installed mods

```bash
h2mm list
h2mm list -v # verbose mode
```

#### Uninstall a mod

```bash
h2mm uninstall -n "Example mod"
h2mm uninstall -i 3 # get the index from the list command
```

#### Enable/disable mods

```bash
h2mm enable -n "Example mod"
h2mm enable -i 3
h2mm disable -n "Example mod"
h2mm disable -i 3
```

#### Updating the script

```bash
h2mm update
```

## Nexus Mods integration

Nexus Mods integration allows you to use the 1-click install feature of Nexus Mods (with the "Vortex" or "Mod manager download" buttons). You can set up Nexus Mods integration by running the following command:

```bash
h2mm nexus-setup
```

You will be walked through the setup process, which will ask you for your Nexus Mods API key and your preferred terminal.

## Compatibility

The script is developed and tested on Arch Linux, but it should work on other Linux distributions as well. If you encounter any issues, please open an issue on the repository.

Status of platforms:

- Linux :white_check_mark:
- Steam Deck :white_check_mark:
- Windows - WSL :white_check_mark:

> The script works on WSL, but you need to specify the path to the Helldivers 2 mods directory manually, to find your Windows partition head to `/mnt/` and from there go to your Helldivers 2 data directory, on a typical install it should be on `/mnt/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Steam/steamapps/common/Helldivers\ 2/data`. You also need to have `unzip` installed, which can be done by running `sudo apt install unzip`. Nexus Mods integration is not supported on WSL.
